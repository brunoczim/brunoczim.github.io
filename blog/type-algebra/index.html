<p>Data types in programming come in all flavours, and to many programmers, the
theories behind them pass unnoticed. In this post I will explain one of these
theories: algebraic data types. Have you ever used a struct/record in your
favourite programming language? That is an algebraic data types. Have your ever
hard about &quot;sum types&quot;? That is also an algebraic data type!</p>
<p>Algebraic data types (ADT) are a way of modelling the combination of data types
using algebra as an analogy. As an example, a struct/record is also called
<em>product type</em> because a record <code>C</code> that combines type <code>A</code> and type <code>B</code> has a
total number of elements equals to total elements of <code>A</code> multiplied by total
elements of <code>B</code>, i.e. <code>|C| = |A| * |B|</code>. This is a very similar concept to an
ordered pair in set theory.</p>
